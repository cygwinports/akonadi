ldesc: "Akonadi is a PIM layer, which provides an asynchronous API to 
access all kind of PIM data (e.g. mails, contacts, events, todos etc.).
It consists of several processes (generally called the Akonadi server)
and a library (called client library) which encapsulates the
communication between the client and the server."
